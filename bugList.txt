' tooltips also resize when the whole thing is resized, code received from Olaf and ColinE66 - testing required
' the following shows methods for changing the properties of specific components (widgets) within the program,
' should be applicable to tooltips for specific widgets?

SomeParent.Widgets("TheWidgetKey").Widget.BackColor = vbBlue

- or

Dim W As cWidgetBase
Set W = SomeParent.Widgets("TheWidgetKey").Widget
W.Backcolor = vbBlue

' upgrade to RC6 new version from Olaf to obtain opacity control over the overlays currently limited to 25%
' monitorProperties, make it work

' msgboxA - replace the standard message boxes with my own.

' tick or smooth scroll for second hand

' separate tooltip code

' RC BUGS & LIMITATIONS
' =====================

' aboutForm is not fading back-in but instantly hiding in DPI aware mode, opacity is acting strangely on second fade in

' Limitation? cannot assign a balloon tooltip (Elroy's) to an object unless it has 
' a .hwnd and a mouseOver event associated with it. I could try to test for a 
' mouseover... and then display the tooltip.
