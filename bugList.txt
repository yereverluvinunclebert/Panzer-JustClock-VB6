' RC BUGS & LIMITATIONS
' =====================

' aboutForm is not fading back-in but instantly hiding in DPI aware mode, opacity is acting strangely on second fade in. Confirmed.

' tooltips also resize when the whole thing is resized, code received from Olaf tested - resizing results in missing text and blank tooltips, using non-standard font centurion light
' RC6 needs a static tooltip option.

' when placing widgets on the main alpha form they take opacity changes and become fully transparent as expected, no problem.
' However, when placing widgets on top of other widgets the opacity cumulates and they become significantly more opaque.
' on circular elements, the surrounding transparent areas become opaque
