' RC BUGS & LIMITATIONS
' =====================

' aboutForm is not fading back-in but instantly hiding in DPI aware mode, opacity is acting strangely on second fade in. Confirmed.

' tooltips also resize when the whole thing is resized, code received from Olaf tested - resizing results in missing text and blank tooltips, using non-standard font centurion light
' RC6 needs a static tooltip option.
