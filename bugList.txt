' https://classicvb.net/samples/HookXP/  CHookMouseWheel.cls
'    Provides MouseWheel events, both vertical and horizontal, for any window that doesn't handle it natively. As Windows has evolved, the base classes
'    that VB controls inherit from have slowly added scrollwheel support. But Windows passes the WM_MOUSEWHEEL message on up the parent chain when this 
'    isn't the case. So, one class can now monitor for any mousewheel activity that isn't already being responded to. This could help allow scrollbars in VB6
'    to react to mousescrollwheel events. Especially iconSettings and the native scrollbar controls.

' https://classicvb.net/samples/HookXP/   CHookMinMax.cls
'    Used to monitor WM_GETMINMAX messages, and restrict the ability of your user to resize your window at will. May be used to set either minimum 
'    or maximum dimensions for a window. Raises GetMinMax event to client, which may then set any legitimate values, which are then passed back to 
'    Windows. Maximum will be enforced even if user punches the Maximize button on your form's toolbar. This could help FCW and the minimum drag that
'    causes tearing.

' https://classicvb.net/samples/HookXP/   CHookMouseEvents.cls
'    This class provides the mysterious MouseEnter, MouseHover, and MouseLeave events, as well as a few bonus features like when the user clicks the
'    4th or 5th buttons on a 5 button mouse. It also provides a collection based scheme whereby you can add and remove windows to monitor just as 
'    you would to an ordinary collection. All events are raised with the associated hWnd so you can determine which control is under the mouse. This 
'    could help the prefs in Pz J. Clock and other tools enabling balloon tooltips on comboBoxes.

' NOTE: hookXP already downloaded.

' RC BUGS & LIMITATIONS
' =====================

' aboutForm is not fading back-in but instantly hiding in DPI aware mode, opacity is acting strangely on second fade in. Confirmed.

' tooltips also resize when the whole thing is resized, code received from Olaf tested - resizing results in missing text and blank tooltips, using non-standard font centurion light
' RC6 needs a static tooltip option.

' when placing widgets on the main alpha form they take opacity changes and become fully transparent as expected, no problem.
' However, when placing widgets on top of other widgets the opacity cumulates and they become significantly more opaque.
' on circular elements, the surrounding transparent areas become opaque

tickButton.opacity = 0;
fAlpha.gaugeForm.Widgets("housing/tickbutton").Widget.Alpha = 0
